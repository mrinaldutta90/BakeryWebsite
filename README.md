# BakeryWebsite

Hello and Welcome to the Readme of the Bakery Challenge Solution  !

To run the solution clone the repo to local and set the path where the JSON file for the source data is kept in the web.config and the app.config for the Test project.

 <add key="LocalJSONPath" value="C:\Mrinal\Projects\BakeryWebsite\SourceJSON.json"/>
 Replace the path with the path where you are keeping the SourceJSON.json.
 I have kept things simple by storing the objects in this JSON file. In an ideal scenario it would have been a relational database.
 
 I have created a simple MVC website to input and output data, just put in the order and Enjoy!
