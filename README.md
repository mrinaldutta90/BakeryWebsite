# BakeryWebsite

Hello and Welcome to the Readme of the Bakery Challenge Solution  !
I have created a simple MVC website to input and output data, just put in the order and Enjoy!

To run the solution clone the repo to local and build.
I have kept things simple by storing the objects in this JSON file included in the solution. In an ideal scenario it would have been a relational database.
